This project was created to consume the api at this repository:
https://github.com/ErikMogensenDK/Testamente

The Blazor application is only done as a brief proof of concept of how API-consumption through the APIClient (found in the Services folder), which was automatically generated using NSwag and is briefly used within the CreatePersonComponent (found in the Components folder).
